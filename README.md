Super basic example of executing a v3.13+ Python file in the command line

1. Make sure you install Python (i used v3.13 from here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-amd64.exe)
    a. On the first page, make sure you "add to the path" option also
2. Open Visual Studio Code and open a folder 
3. Create or copy the `sample.py` file and vs code should ask to install the Python tools (do it)
4. Once the python code is in the file, make sure its saved
5. Open the command line for vs code (ctrl+shift+` OR use the tool menu at the top)
6. In the command line, make sure you are in the right folder
7. type in `python sample.py -h` to see how to use the function (this is basically what line 20+ does in the file)
8. You can run it with something like: `python sample.py Jason 25` to see the output
9. You can make more python files and just reference them if you want to try on your own
